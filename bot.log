2025-03-07 01:33:30,660 [INFO] Final Answer: If StellarAIO is not opening on your desktop, try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check Task Manager**  
   - Open **Task Manager** (`Ctrl + Shift + Esc`) and look for **StellarAIO** in the list of running processes.  
   - If you see it running but not opening visibly, try ending the process and reopening the application.

2. **Run with Logs**  
   - Open **Command Prompt** (`Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter).  
   - Drag the **StellarAIO shortcut** (desktop icon) into the Command Prompt window.  
   - Press **Enter** to run StellarAIO with logs and check for any error messages.

3. **Delete Config File (If Getting Unhandled Error)**  
   - Click on the **magnifying glass** in the taskbar and type `%appdata%`.  
   - Navigate to the **StellarAIO** folder and delete the `config.json` file.  
   - Restart StellarAIO (Note: This will delete all saved settings).

4. **Reinstall StellarAIO**  
   - If the issue persists, try reinstalling StellarAIO:  
     - Go to the **StellarAIO Discord server**.  
     - Check the `#change-log` channel for the latest update.  
     - Download and install the latest version.

5. **Check for Updates**  
   - StellarAIO should update automatically when opened.  
   - If it fails to update, manually download the latest version from the **Stellar Dashboard**.

6. **Check Virtual Server Issues (If Applicable)**  
   - If you're running StellarAIO on a **virtual server**, there may be an issue with compatibility.  
   - Check if other users are experiencing the same issue in the StellarAIO Discord.

If none of these steps work, you may need to wait for an update from the StellarAIO team. Let me know if you need further assistance! 🚀

2025-03-07 22:10:44,856 [INFO] Final Answer: Good afternoon!  

The error message **"country invalid must be 2 letter country code"** suggests that the country code you are using in your CSV file is incorrect. StellarAIO likely requires the **ISO 3166-1 alpha-2** country code format.  

For the **United Kingdom**, the correct **2-letter country code** is:  
**GB** (not UK)  

### Solution:  
Try updating your CSV file and replace **UK** with **GB**, then reattempt the import.  

Let me know if you need further assistance! 😊

2025-03-07 23:07:09,328 [INFO] Final Answer: To refer a friend, you likely need to use a unique referral link. If your friend joins without using your link, the referral may not be counted. 

Check if there is a referral section in your account or ask support for your personal referral link. Then, share that link with your friend and ensure they sign up using it. 

If you need more details, you can check the relevant channels like <#980942201431400498> or <#815050359932059679> for recommendations. Let me know if you need further help! 😊

2025-03-07 23:12:41,036 [INFO] Final Answer: If someone joined but didn't use your referral link, they may not be counted as your referral. You can try the following steps:

1. **Check Referral Terms** – Review the referral program's terms to see if there’s a way to manually claim a referral.
2. **Contact Support** – Reach out to the platform’s support team and provide details (e.g., the username of the person who joined and proof of your referral).
3. **Ask the Person to Rejoin** – If possible, ask the person to sign up again using your referral link.

Let me know if you need help with anything else! 😊

2025-03-07 23:31:43,680 [INFO] Final Answer: Hi! Monitoring status 520 for Walmart typically indicates an unknown error or an issue with the request being sent to Walmart's servers. This could be caused by a temporary server issue, a problem with your proxies, or Walmart blocking the request.  

To troubleshoot:  
- Try switching to different proxies (ISP or residential) and see if the issue persists.  
- Check if Walmart is experiencing any downtime or changes to their site.  
- Lower your monitor delay slightly to see if it improves detection.  

If the issue continues, let us know, and we can assist further! 😊

2025-03-07 23:33:03,149 [INFO] Final Answer: It looks like you're encountering a temporary profile/card ban while running Walmart CA tasks. This issue has been reported by multiple users, and currently, there is no definitive solution. Walmart's security settings can be quite strict, which may be causing your card to get flagged.  

Here are a few things you can try:  
- Switch to a different payment method or card.  
- Try running tasks with increased delays to reduce detection.  
- If using guest checkout, consider trying an account-based checkout instead.  
- Experiment with different proxy providers or types (residential vs. ISP).  

If the issue persists, you may need to wait until Walmart's security settings ease up or until further updates are provided by the Stellar team. Let us know if you need any further assistance! 🚀

Once an event is activated, your product is being monitored, and if a restock happens, a new task group will be created and started automatically to add the product to the cart and proceed to checkout. 

You'll receive a notification via Discord webhook when Stellar detects a restock and when an Automation Task group is created and started. Keep an eye on your notifications to stay updated on restocks in real time! Let me know if you need any further clarification. 😊

2025-03-07 23:37:24,985 [INFO] Final Answer: It looks like your payment was unsuccessful due to an outdated card, and you need to update your payment method to regain access to the Discord server. Here’s what you can do:

1. **Update Your Payment Method:**
   - Log into your **Whop** account.
   - Navigate to **Your Orders** > **Manage Membership**.
   - Update your payment details with your new debit card.

2. **Retry the Payment:**
   - Once your payment method is updated, Whop should attempt to charge your card again automatically.
   - If the charge does not go through, you may need to manually re-subscribe or contact Whop support for assistance.

3. **Check Your Discord Access:**
   - After a successful payment, your access to the Stellar Discord should be restored.
   - If you still can’t log in, try unlinking and relinking your Discord account in Whop.

If you continue to have issues, feel free to reach out, and we’ll be happy to assist further! 🚀
