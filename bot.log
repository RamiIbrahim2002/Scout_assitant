2025-03-07 01:33:30,660 [INFO] Final Answer: If StellarAIO is not opening on your desktop, try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check Task Manager**  
   - Open **Task Manager** (`Ctrl + Shift + Esc`) and look for **StellarAIO** in the list of running processes.  
   - If you see it running but not opening visibly, try ending the process and reopening the application.

2. **Run with Logs**  
   - Open **Command Prompt** (`Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter).  
   - Drag the **StellarAIO shortcut** (desktop icon) into the Command Prompt window.  
   - Press **Enter** to run StellarAIO with logs and check for any error messages.

3. **Delete Config File (If Getting Unhandled Error)**  
   - Click on the **magnifying glass** in the taskbar and type `%appdata%`.  
   - Navigate to the **StellarAIO** folder and delete the `config.json` file.  
   - Restart StellarAIO (Note: This will delete all saved settings).

4. **Reinstall StellarAIO**  
   - If the issue persists, try reinstalling StellarAIO:  
     - Go to the **StellarAIO Discord server**.  
     - Check the `#change-log` channel for the latest update.  
     - Download and install the latest version.

5. **Check for Updates**  
   - StellarAIO should update automatically when opened.  
   - If it fails to update, manually download the latest version from the **Stellar Dashboard**.

6. **Check Virtual Server Issues (If Applicable)**  
   - If you're running StellarAIO on a **virtual server**, there may be an issue with compatibility.  
   - Check if other users are experiencing the same issue in the StellarAIO Discord.

If none of these steps work, you may need to wait for an update from the StellarAIO team. Let me know if you need further assistance! 🚀

2025-03-07 22:10:44,856 [INFO] Final Answer: Good afternoon!  

The error message **"country invalid must be 2 letter country code"** suggests that the country code you are using in your CSV file is incorrect. StellarAIO likely requires the **ISO 3166-1 alpha-2** country code format.  

For the **United Kingdom**, the correct **2-letter country code** is:  
**GB** (not UK)  

### Solution:  
Try updating your CSV file and replace **UK** with **GB**, then reattempt the import.  

Let me know if you need further assistance! 😊
